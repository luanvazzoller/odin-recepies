 A simple project built following Odin Project Curriculum
## Project Intentions
*I'm building this simple project to practice my HTML skills while I follow the Odin Project Curriculum!*
### Skills ###
*At this time, I'll practice only with very basic HTML tags, like:*

- < p> A paragraph tag
- < a> A hypertext link tag
- < h1> A heading tag
- < ul> An unordered list tag
- < ol> An ordered list tag
- < img> An image tag

 
*Obs: A space was used in those tags for them not to be interpreted as real HTML tags.*

*And some parameters of some tags too!*
