    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use your air fryer to fry eggs if you are in a hurry and need a quick on-the go-breakfast. Cut and shape your foil the night before and let your air fryer do the work for you while your coffee brews in the morning. </p>
        <p>No ramekin required! If you increase your foil size to 8x10 inches you can cook 2 eggs at a time</p>
